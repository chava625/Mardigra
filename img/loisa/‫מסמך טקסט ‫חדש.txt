   A Museum on a Mission
When you make a child’s potential visible, wonderful things happen. So we created a place where kids use play, shared exploration, and conversation to connect with the people and world around them. A place where kids can be the amazing humans they are. A place where wonderful things happen daily.

The LCM Vision
What you experience as a child shapes the adult you become. That means you can change a child’s entire trajectory by giving them access to safe, innovative, and educational play experiences. And that’s the stuff we live for. We’re here to show children they matter. We exist to strengthen and support families. And we’re going to have so much fun while we do it.
The Louisiana Children's Museum's  has opened in their new home in New Orleans City Park!
