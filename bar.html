      Success in sports and success in life often come from similar paths. Brandon Landry has turned the traits he learned as a college basketball walk-on into virtues that he shares freely with everyone on the Walk-On’s team as part of his life’s calling. Today, with over 100 locations in the works across 15 states, the sky is the limit. Walk-On’s operates with a mission of delivering a memorable game day experience with a taste of Louisiana created by an All-American team. Brandon regularly and proudly shares his goal with everyone on his team – To Win!
      There’s really no better way to describe the uniqueness of Walk-On’s Sports Bistreaux. We start every dish from scratch and use fresh ingredients to bring our mouthwatering, Cajun cuisine to life. And whether you’re here for dinner with the family, date night, cocktails with the girls or to watch a game on the big screen, we’re always happy to share our Louisiana culture with you.
      When we opened the first Walk-On’s restaurant we wanted a great, family-friendly place for people to come enjoy great food, cold beer and sports. We’ve been so fortunate to accomplish that and much more. As we have grown, our customers and communities continue to welcome us with open arms. We want to give back to the communities in which we operate and thank our fans. We work to do this by supporting what is important in those communities. From golf tournaments, silent auctions, youth sports, local schools and more, we enjoy sharing our team, food, and fun throughout the community. We appreciate your support and look forward to supporting your next event!
